## Uber Clone

Using mainly Expo, React Native, Redux, Tailwind, and Google Apis, I created a clone of Uber. Wanted to take a look at the React Native Ecosystem and some other popular packages.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `expo start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
